This is a program that automatically solves the [NYT Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee)!
To run the program:
1. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you type `python` into a command prompt or terminal and it says something like `Python 3.x.x`, you have it installed.
2. Open a command prompt or a terminal inside the Spelling Bee folder and type: `python main.py`.
